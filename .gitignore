# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Don't share local db credentials into repo -- there is a database-sample.yml file as example
/config/database.yml

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp
